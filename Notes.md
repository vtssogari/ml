# Machine Learning

## Spark MLLib Classic ML Routine

### Find usecase with clear classification problem 
  1. Y/N
  2. Problem code
  2. final decision
### Select columns for features which shouldn't include any form of predicting output

### Convert columns values to vectors 

### Use StringIndexer to convert string value to vector

### Use vectorindexer to optimize the prediction

### Use Assembler to combine all the vectors into single feature column

### Use Pipeline to automate the training 

### Setup algorithm with params

### build model

### show importance variables 

### Apply the model to testing set

### Compare the accuracy
